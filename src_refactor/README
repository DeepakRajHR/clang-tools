* Goal:

  - Write a bare minimum source to source translation using clang

  - A struct defined as following

      struct ST {
        ...
      };

      // usage
      struct ST var;
      
    and was refactored as 

      typedef struct ST {
      ...
      } ST_T;

      // usage
      ST_T var;

  - Refactor all occurrences of struct ST to ST_T
